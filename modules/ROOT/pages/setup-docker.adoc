= Getting Set Up (using Docker)

== Preliminary Notes

It is now easier to get started on developing the Fedora Websites with the use
of Docker (or Podman).

We ship a `Dockerfile` which will install dependencies into an image
for you, so all you are left to do is mount the site as a volume, pull
translations, and start the development server.

[NOTE]
====
The documentation here refers to `docker`, but our fairly simple use
of it means that things are likely to work with `podman` with little
modification.

== Building the container image

First clone the repository:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://pagure.io/fedora-web/websites.git
----

(You may instead clone your fork of it, or add your fork as a second
remote later on.)

Now ensure Docker is running and run:

[source,bash]
----
sudo docker build -t fedora-websites .
----

This will generate a container image for you to use.

== Pulling translations

We have a script for pulling translations. Let's call it from within
the container:

[source,bash]
----
sudo docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/opt/:z" fedora-websites ./scripts/pull-translations.sh
----


Notice here that we are mounting a volume (`-v`) in Docker which
points to our check-out of the repository. We're referring to the
`fedora-websites` image created above, and calling the
`./scripts/pull-translations.sh` script from within it.

== Running the development server

Now we are ready to run the development server:

[source,bash]
----
sudo docker run -it --rm -v "$(pwd):/opt/:z" -p 5000:5000 fedora-websites flask run --reload --host 0.0.0.0
----

Note that we need `-p 5000:5000` so that we can access the development
server from our actual host. Also notice that we need to tell Flask to
listen on `0.0.0.0` as by default it listens on `127.0.0.1` which
won't be accessible outside of the container.

You may now go to `http://localhost:5000/` in your browser of choice.

Now you are ready to go and any changes you make in the repository
should be reflected immediately upon refreshing the page in your
browser.
