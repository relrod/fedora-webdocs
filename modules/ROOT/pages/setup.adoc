= Getting Set Up

[NOTE]
====
We now have documentation on using the `Dockerfile` which ships in the Fedora
websites repository, and suggest trying that method before using the method
outlined on this page. See link:../setup-docker[this tutorial].

== Preliminary Notes

There are some open tickets (https://pagure.io/fedora-web/websites/issue/31[31],
https://pagure.io/fedora-web/websites/issue/11[11]) about getting the websites
repository building on Fedora with Python 3.

However, it should be able to be built on Fedora 30, using Python 2 packages,
for now.

=== Fedora 29 Alternative

Note, the dependencies below may not currently resolve due to package renaming
in Fedora 30. If the dependencies do not resolve in Fedora 30, running Flask
from a Fedora 29 container is an alternative. An example to run the Fedora 29
container using `podman` is as follows:

```
# Expose the default port for Flask, 5000.
podman run --expose 5000 --net=host --privileged -v /path/to/websites/repo:/path/to/websites/repo -ti registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:29
```

== Dependencies

That said, assuming Fedora 30, install the dependencies as follows
footnote:[This list comes directly from the Fedora Infrastructure OpenShift
build for Websites found
https://infrastructure.fedoraproject.org/cgit/ansible.git/tree/roles/openshift-apps/websites/templates/buildconfig.yml[here].]:

[source,bash]
----
dnf install \
        git \
        python-flask \
        python-frozen-flask \
        python-flask-assets \
        python-rjsmin \
        python-cssmin \
        python-flask-babel \
        python-flask-htmlmin \
        python-cssutils \
        rubygem-sass \
        babel \
        python3-jinja2 \
        python-pyyaml \
        python-dateutil \
        python-dogpile-cache \
        python-requests \
        python-zanata-client
----

== Pull Strings

Now we need to pull the current translations. After installing the dependencies
above, you can `cd` into `sites/getfedora.org/` and run:
`./scripts/pull-translations.sh`.

Once the dependencies are installed and translations are pulled, you can do one
of two things:

== Use the Development Server

One option is to use the Flask built-in development server. This is handy
because it prevents you from needing to build the websites every time you change
something. However, it bypasses the Frozen-Flask system which creates are static
sites, entirely, so it's not entirely an accurate representation of what goes
live.

To use the development server:

[source,bash]
----
export FLASK_APP=main.py
flask run --reload
----

Now you many visit http://localhost:5000/ to get to the site.

== Use Apache

Alternatively, you may simply run `python main.py`. You'll get a statically
built site in the `./build/` directory. However, the HTML files are all
language-code-suffixed as Apache/httpd MultiViews system expects
(e.g. `index.html.en`). As a result you *cannot* just run a simple HTTP server
(like `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`) in the `./build/` directory, unfortunately.

You can, however, set up an Apache on your system, and point it to the
`./build/` directory.

[NOTE]
====
(We should probably add an example Apache config here at some point).
